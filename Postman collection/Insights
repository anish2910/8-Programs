Collection in Postman means a group of API requests that are already saved in the Postman and can be arranged into folders.
Any number of folders can be created inside a collection.
Putting similar requests into folders and collections helps the client in better organization and documentation of their requests.
All the APIs requests can be stored and saved within a collection, and these collections can be shared amongst the team in the Postman workspace.

**********POST***********
The post is an HTTP method like GET. We use this method when additional information needs to be sent to the server inside the body of the request.
In general, when we submit a POST request, we expect to have some change on the server, such as updating, removing or inserting.

One of the best examples of using POST request is the login page of Facebook or the login page of other sites;


*********GET*************
GET request contains all information inside the URL, and because of that,
some people do not prefer to use GET request while they are sending some confidential data such as passwords.
For example, if you search anything on Google, you actually using a GET request because there is no sensitive information, and you are just requesting the page.
You can try to search for something on Google; you will get the same search string in the URL.
